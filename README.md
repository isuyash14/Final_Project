# Monte Carlo Simulation Scenario & Purpose:
The purpose of this simulation predict the cost of completion of a project. The University Startup IT company hires graduate students with skillsets to work within 3 of the following teams.

1. Design 
2. Development 
3. Testing 

These student's hourly wage depends on their skillset and their total wage would depend on the number of hours they have worked on that particular task.

## Simulation's variables of uncertainty

1. Fixed Cost for the completion of the project
    - Beta-PERT Distribution  
2. Total overhead cost associated with the project (Resources, Interviewing cost, Training, Certification)
    - Beta-Pert Distribution


List and describe your simulation's variables of uncertainty (where you're using pseudo-random number generation). For each such variable, how did you decide the range and probability distribution to use?  Do you think it's a good representation of reality?

## Hypothesis or hypotheses before running the simulation:

1. The time of completion of each task is as follows:
    i. Design - 14 hours
    ii. Development - 10 hours
    iii. Testing - 6 hours
    
2. The overhead cost would be a result of extra hours worked to a particular task. Which would range between 5% and 40%.

3. The min and max values of the salary given to the graduate asssistant as per UIUC regulations varies from $8.25/hour to $18.00/hour depending on the position and skillset.

## Analytical Summary of your findings: (e.g. Did you adjust the scenario based on previous simulation outcomes?  What are the management decisions one could make from your simulation's output, etc.)
