# Monte Carlo Simulation Scenario & Purpose:
The purpose of this simulation predict the cost of completion of a project. The hypothetical IT company hires graduate students with skillsets to work within 3 of the following teams.

1. Design (Team of 2)
2. Development (Team of 5)
3. Testing (Team of 3)


## Simulation's variables of uncertainty

1. Fixed Cost for the completion of the project
    - Normal Distribution 
2. Total overhead cost associated with the project (Resources, Interviewing cost, Training, Certification) (30%)
    - Normal Distribution


List and describe your simulation's variables of uncertainty (where you're using pseudo-random number generation). For each such variable, how did you decide the range and probability distribution to use?  Do you think it's a good representation of reality?

## Hypothesis or hypotheses before running the simulation:

## Analytical Summary of your findings: (e.g. Did you adjust the scenario based on previous simulation outcomes?  What are the management decisions one could make from your simulation's output, etc.)

## Instructions on how to use the program:
